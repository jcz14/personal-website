    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>I'm Jim, a fourth-year bioinformatics major at the <a href="http://pitt.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a>. This is my personal website, take a look around and
    enjoy yourself~!</p>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I need to put something here...</p>

    <h1>My Goals</h1>
    <p>Right now I'm just an undergraduate student, and I know that that will not be the end of my educational experience. I plan to continue with my graduate studies
    immediately after I get my bachelor's degree while working a part-time job. After I earn my master's I will likely continue working, wherever that may be. My ultimate
    goal is to secure a position at the National Human Genome Research Institute of the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>
