    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>I'm Jim, a fourth-year bioinformatics major at the <a href="http://pitt.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a>.
    This is my personal website, take a look around and enjoy yourself~!</p>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>The background image is an overhead view of Davis, California, the city I'm from. It's got a population of
    roughly 65000 people from all over the world, and as a result I'm exposed to all sorts of cultures and traditions
    from the friends I made up until high school graduation. I came to study in Pittsburgh because, well, I wanted a
    change of scenery and some freedom to explore. For starters, the weather's <i>really</i> different, and the city is
    a lot bigger, both in size and population. Of course I also considered where Pitt's bioinformatics major lies in
    national rankings, and it's surprisingly high. Safe to say, I feel like I definitely made the right choice coming
    here and experiencing everything the campus and city has to offer.</p>

    <p>My interests include
      <ul>
        <li>Programming: I know C++, Java, Python, Perl, and more recently PHP. In my spare time I often write programs
        for personal use, whether it's to automate a repetitive task or do something completely new in an intuitive way.</li>
        <li>Reading: I read a lot. Usually it's blogs or forums, other times it's books. Regardless of the medium, I
        always try to learn something new from what I read, especially if it's something applicable to what I do. My
        favorite book genres are science fiction and fantasy.</li>
        <li>Video games: Yeah, sounds pretty stereotypical for a college student, huh? Most of the ones I play are
        multi-player, mainly because it lets me interact with real people as opposed to preprogrammed characters. Part
        of what makes multiplayer games fun is the competition or cooperation they entail, and if I'm not doing anything
        "productive" I'm probably in a game of Overwatch with my friends.</li>
        <li>Basketball: I'm nowhere near the level of good, but it's fun exercise and I've been watching it ever since I
        could understand what it was thanks to my parents. They're not exactly NBA fanatics, but they love watching the
        televised games while taking guesses as to which team's going to win or who's going to make the game-winning
        shot. I guess you can say I play it for exercise and because I know how it's played.</li>
        <li>Music: I play the piano. I like music. Is that enough? No? Well, I enjoy all kinds of music, from heavy
        pumping EDM to quiet classical compositions. Sometimes I compose music, too, whether it's a self-made cover of
        something that keeps repeating in my mind or a tune that randomly comes into my consciousness and happens to
        sound like something coherent.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>My Goals</h1>
    <p>Right now I'm just an undergraduate student, though I know that that will not be the end of my educational
    experience. I plan to continue with graduate studies immediately after I get my bachelor's degree, as well as find a
    part-time job. That will most likely be working under a professor, though I'm also open to entry-level positions in
    corporate settings. My dream job is to work for the National Human Genome Research Institute of the
    <a href="https://www.nih.gov/" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health</a> and contribute to scientific
    research that improves both the safety and efficacy of healthcare.</p>
