    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>I'm Jim, a fourth-year bioinformatics major at the <a href="http://pitt.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a>.
    This is my personal website, take a look around and enjoy yourself~!</p>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I need to put something here...</p>

    <h1>My Goals</h1>
    <p>Right now I'm just an undergraduate student, though I know that that will not be the end of my educational
    experience. I plan to continue with graduate studies immediately after I get my bachelor's degree, as well as find a
    part-time job. That will most likely be working under a professor, though I'm also open to entry-level positions in
    corporate settings. My dream job is to work for the National Human Genome Research Institute of the
    <a href="https://www.nih.gov/" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health</a> and contribute to scientific
    research that improves both the safety and efficacy of healthcare.</p>
