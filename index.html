    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>I'm Jim, a fourth-year bioinformatics major at the <a href="http://pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a>. Though this website's primary
    purpose is for a class project, if you take a look around you'll see that it's eventually going to become something that I use to sell myself to potential
    employers. Currently contained on this website are some facts about me (what you're looking at right now!), my education and work experience, and a
    realistic-looking but non-working contact form. That's because this website currently uses nothing but hand-written HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any
    server-side scripts or database systems. By the end of this term, however, that form will be fully functional and the entire website will look a lot different
    than what you see now.</p>
