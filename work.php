    <h1>Current Work</h1>
    <p>I'm currently working on <a href="http://drugquery.csb.pitt.edu/disco/" target="_blank">DISCO</a>, a service that
    provides results which can be used as a benchmark in predicting the feasibility of protein-ligand docking
    interactions. The front-end uses PHP and the calculations are done with custom-made Python scripts. The goal of this
    project is to create a tool which will be used by researchers and analysts in their work as a benchmark to evaluate
    the results of algorithms that predict protein-ligand interactions.</p>

    <h1>2015-2016</h1>
    <p>In my third year of university I was offered a paid full-time position as a data analyst for a paper on the
    application and proposal of improvements to the FDA's structured product labeling (SPL) standard, which uses XML to
    define a standardized information exchange and definition format for labels included with all drug products sold
    within the United States. This position gave me the opportunity to experience the process one takes to publish a
    paper in a widely-circulated scientific journal, from the planning phase to the publication phase and everything in
    between.</p>

    <h1>2013-2014</h1>
    <p>My first job was a part-time research assistant position at the University of Calfornia in Davis. During my time
    there I received national-grade biological safety training, which allowed me to safely work with live animal tissue
    and blood samples. I learned the basics of contemporary lab techniques such as ELISA, SDS-PAGE, buffer preparation,
    and ion-channel protein separation. I also worked on the data acquisition and storage routines of an in-house
    program developed by the members of the research lab.</p>
