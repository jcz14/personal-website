Personal Website
======
This is my personal website. It started out as a project for my web design class, and I plan to keep updating it since it'll be something I can use to show others what I've learned in that class.

With the exception of the image credits page, the entire website is written in PHP, with JavaScript for form handling and CSS stylesheets for the visuals. It's self-hosted, and a live version can be found [here](http://jcz95.dynu.com/~jim/WmGXQ5YvdzSYCG8l/). Things can change at any time, so don't expect something to be where it was next time you come back.

"personal-website-part1.zip" is a snapshot of this repository at the time of part 1's submission.
